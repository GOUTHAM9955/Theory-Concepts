What is a server :
	A server is a powerful computer or software system that provides services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers are integral to various computing environments, from small local networks to large-scale internet services.

	Servers can be classified into 2 types
			Physical servers: With dedicated CPU and RAM
			Virtual servers: : Use Hyperwiser to divide physical server into 2 or more virtual servers
			Using RAID configuration we prevent data loss incase of a hard disc failure as it copies the data into multiple desks and would rebuild the data into new hard drives
			A server needs an OS to run ex: Windows, Linux or MAC which should be robust and stable.
